This is a project about classifying top cash crops in Ghana. The idea came about because the agricultural sector is not well funded in Ghana. I Think with deep learning we can improve the performance of the agricultural sector in Ghana. Making it more accessible to many who will like to invest in the sector whiles making a great change on the continent. This app classifies among cocoa, beans and pineapple. This is done using a neural network. This is an image classification problem. The constraints of this app is that it is able to distinguish among the 3 main cash crops listed above. This app is to give the idea of the power of deep learning in solving image classification problems.
